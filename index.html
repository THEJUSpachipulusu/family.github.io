                                    My name is Maisara but I'd like to be called as Sara. I'm 29 years old and a married woman. I'm the second child and the only girl among my 3 brothers in my nuclear family. I'm very closed with my parents and all of my siblings especially with my youngest brother since he lived with me and my husband.
    
    I think my family tree is unique because I have a cross-cultural extended family. I have uncles and aunts (from my father side) with a different religious beliefs and cultures which are Christian, Buddhist, Hindu and Pagan. Therefore, we always had a great time gathering together especially when it comes to a festival and celebration days like on Eid Al-Fitr, Christmas, Chinese New Year, Diwali and wedding ceremonies as well. In fact, this is a common situation in my country especially in my home town.
    
    Malaysia actually has two regions which are Peninsular Malaysia and Malaysian Borneo (also known as East Malaysia) and they're separated by South China Sea. I live in Sabah which is situated in Borneo. In my country, Sabah is also known as ‘A Land below the Wind'. We have several of mountains along with a green mountain ranges and natural lifes. We also have lots of beautiful island and white sandy beaches along our coast. It's a right destination for people who love snorkeling or scuba diving.
    
    I also love to watch film, listen to music or visiting to my sibling's house in my spare time. Other than that, I love to travel as well. My husband and I always spend our holidays to go to new places whether it's in our country or to go abroad.
    
    I took Psychology Counselling while I was in University. After I graduated, I work as a Counsellor in Juvenile Centre which is been under Social Welfare Department for about 5 years. I love my job because it gives me a lot of experiences and shows me a different range of life backgrounds and human behaviours specifically for the youth. All these experiences are useful to myself and make me realize how I should be grateful for having a nice and loving family.
    
    However, sometimes I've had a hard time since there are a lot of challenges as well. But even so, I've tried to look in a positive side, because I know dealing with human isn't an easy thing. In order to improve my work performance and myself, I believe there are still many things I have to learn, and need to strive for having a better life in the future.
